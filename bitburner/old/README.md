These are some older scripts that I made when I was both uncertain of the game scope and not the greatest at formatting/creating code. 

If you want to use these start.js is what you run and it will initialize some variables in the json file target.txt, then run automator.js which loops through hacknetserver, serverbuyer, commandcenter, homeenum and basic. enum.js grabs some info about the current host and all faction related boxes*. crawler and basic contain some useful functions that other scripts import. the others are largely 'on-demand' scripts that fulfil some kind of immediate need. 

hacknetserver and serverbuyer will guzzle your money unless you change the hard coded cash variable, changed in new scripts.
