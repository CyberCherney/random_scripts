This is a repo for scripts I make and use for games, hacking, or automation. Below is a bit better explanation of the directories and how to traverse them

## bitburner
___

Used for the bitburner game, there are old scripts that I will rewrite if I ever get around to it. Has some spoilers, though admittedly not many. The scripts in tandem are an afk hacking daisy chain to generate cash then buy more resources for hacking. Might not work starting off with the limited RAM and that is why I intend to rewrite it. 

## hacking
___

Broken down even further generally into scripts for various challenges, automation, or misc. In misc are some of my skeletons for custom exploits and other one off scripts I use.


## home automation
___

Some primitive automation of GPIO pins and database management for a pi on my network. Will be more here in the future after I have more tech to automate.
