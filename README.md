This is a repo for scripts I make and use for games, hacking, or automation. Below is a bit better explanation of the directories and how to traverse them

## bitburner

Used for the bitburner game; [https://bitburner-official.github.io/](https://bitburner-official.github.io/), there are old scripts that I will rewrite if I ever get around to it. Has some spoilers, though admittedly past the initial start of the game they aren't relevant. The scripts in tandem are an afk hacking daisy chain to generate cash then buy more resources for hacking. Might not work starting off with the limited RAM and does not automate various mechanics. 

## hacking

Broken down even further generally into scripts for various challenges, automation, or misc. In misc are some of my skeletons for custom exploits and other one off scripts I use. 


## home automation

Primitive automation of GPIO pins and database management for a pi on my network. Will be more here in the future after I have more tech to automate. Potential project can be found below:

Flipper Zero Keepsmile Bluetooth Light App (or [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration)  
PC Case LED corresponding to room temp  
Ambient underlighting an inverse intensity of outdoors  
Hummingbird feeder camera + auto picture snapping  
Looping music assistant (for pseudo randomizing loops I make)  
"Radio station" site replaying random songs I've looped
