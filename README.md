This is a repo for scripts I make and use for games, hacking, or automation. Below is a bit better explanation of the directories and how to traverse them

## bitburner
___

Used for the bitburner game, there are old scripts that I will rewrite if I ever get around to it. Has some spoilers, though admittedly not many. The scripts in tandem are an afk hacking daisy chain to generate cash then buy more resources for hacking. Might not work starting off and that is why I intend to rewrite it. 

## hacking
___

For scripts that I reference in writeups and that I use to solve challenges.


## home automation
___

Some primitive automation of GPIO pins and database management for a pi on my network. Might be more here in the future.
